# Are you about to submit a pull request to make the master branch “comply” with ISO-8601?

Stop stop stop stop stop stop! **Read the README!** ES5 does not implement the full ISO-8601 standard!
Use the [LAX branch](https://github.com/csnover/js-iso8601/tree/lax)!

# Anything else

Contribute away!
